# Laptop_Price_Prediction_Model
This project is based on supervised machine Learning algorithm (Random Forest) to predict prices of various laptops sets based on their features. It analyzes a large dataset of various laptops with the features that affect there prices and the total price. Analyzing them it takes input from user through a streamlit web application and then predicts the target variable i.e. price of laptop.
